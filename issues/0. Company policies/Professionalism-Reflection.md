#### What are examples of professional vs. unprofessional behaviour in a casual work environment?

In a casual work environment like Focus Bear, professionalism is more about behavior than formality.

Professional behaviour examples:
* Being late to a remote meeting but sending a quick Slack message like:
“Hey, sorry — running 2 minutes late due to internet issues.”
* Disagreeing with someone in Slack by saying: “I see your point. One concern I have is X — what do you think about Y?”
* Dressing casually but still appropriate for video calls (clean, presentable).

Unprofessional behaviour examples:
* Joining meetings late without explanation.
* Using sarcasm, all caps, or dismissive language in Slack.
* Ignoring messages that require a response, even if just to say “I’ll get back to this.”

#### What does respectful communication look like in remote teams? (e.g., tone in messages, handling disagreements, responding to feedback)
Respectful communication in remote teams means being clear, patient, and mindful of time zones.

#### How can you give and receive feedback professionally? (e.g., focus on actions, not people; assume good intent; ask for clarification instead of reacting defensively)
Ask for guidance whenever something is unclear or mistakes are made, and whenever you can advise someone, help in the calmest way possible. 
To give feedback you have to focus on actions, not the person.
For example:
* Instead of "This if wrong", I would say: "I think this part could be clearer if we change the function name and the same with the variables"

When receiving feedback, I would:
* Assume good intent
* Do questions if something is unclear for me
* Apply the feedback and confirm that I understand

## 📝 Reflection

#### Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?
While I haven’t had formal workplace experience yet, I’ve seen strong teamwork in group projects and online collaborations.
For example, in group assignments, the teams that worked best had:
* Clear division of responsibilities.
* Regular check-ins.
* People helping each other instead of blaming when something went wrong.

This showed me that professionalism isn’t about hierarchy, but about accountability and communication.

#### What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?
I can:
* Be specific in my messages
* Avoid assumptions and ask questions instead
* Use respectful language even when stressed or unsure
* Acknowledge others’ input so they feel heard.

#### How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?
* Always showing a formal and respectful attitude 
* Offering help wheni notice someone needs
* Keeping communication friendly but respectful

#### How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?
Before meetings, I would:
* Review the agenda or context.
* Write down questions or updates I need to share.

#### What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?
Being proactive:
* Sharing progress and updates
* Asking questions early instead of waiting until i'm stuck
* Letting my upervisor know if I finish tasks early and asking what to work on next

#### How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?
Always through the appropriate channels of communication; if I don't get answers, I'll try to keep my account active until they have time.
