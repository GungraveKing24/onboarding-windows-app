#### What are examples of professional vs. unprofessional behaviour in a casual work environment? (Hint: Think about communication, meeting etiquette, and teamwork.)
Professionally, it is appropriate to dress appropriately in formal attire, or in some cases not too formal but not in casual clothes either; communicating effectively without harsh words or shouting is professionally correct, as is respecting different opinions.

#### What does respectful communication look like in remote teams? (e.g., tone in messages, handling disagreements, responding to feedback)
Please respect response times for those living in other countries, and use respectful language when asking questions.
#### How can you give and receive feedback professionally? (e.g., focus on actions, not people; assume good intent; ask for clarification instead of reacting defensively)
Ask for guidance whenever something is unclear or mistakes are made, and whenever you can advise someone, help in the calmest way possible.
