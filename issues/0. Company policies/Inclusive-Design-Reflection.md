Thank you for sharing how you're feeling.

We want you to know that you're not failing. It's very common to struggle to start or maintain a routine.

Focus Bear isn't here to punish you, but to support you. You can progress little by little, take a break when you need to, and you decide when it's time to pick it up again.

If you weren't able to complete the routine today, don't worry. Tomorrow is another opportunity, and we're here to make things easier for you, not harder.

If you need help, we're here to help.
