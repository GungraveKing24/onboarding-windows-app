#### What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
Focus Bear combines distraction blocking with habit and routine suppor, not just block apps like others.
Bloquea distracciones en dispositivos pero tambien incluye la creacion de rutinas y habitos. 
Ademas incluye guias para rutinas y temporizadores de descanso, seccion de concentracion.
En resumen focus bear tiene todas estas caracteristicas y mas integradas en una sola aplicacion y no por separado, lo cual mejora el rendimiento del usuario al solo tener que usar una y no varias a la vez.

#### If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
Because it combines so many tools into one, it's more convenient for me to have all the features I need to organize my day or routines in a single application instead of switching between them and filling up my storage.

#### What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
Not a feature, but they don't have an Android app, but they do have AI-powered visual planning and offer color-coded timelines.
(Based on what I saw, because I don't have an iPhone)

#### Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
Visual planning of routines, also being able to create more detailed records for complete repeatable routines, such as schedules and different times in the concentration time planning to be able to create one that has several hours and not separately.
