#### What caused the conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes because the same file was modified on the same lines in two different branches.

#### How did you resolve it?
Using the Git client, I reviewed the differences shown during the merge and decided which changes to keep and which to discard. Then I committed the resolution, and the commit worked.

#### What did you learn?
That merge conflicts are not errors, but rather part of collaborative work. They are normal, and I also understood that it is important to make frequent pulls to keep the code up to date.
