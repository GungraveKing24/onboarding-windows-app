#### What makes a good commit message?
A good message needs to be clear and descriptive; it should explain what was modified and why the change was made, for example, if something was modified that affected an important function, in order to correct it.

Best practices:
- Use short, clear sentences
- Start with a verb in the present tense (Add, Fix, Update)
- Focus on a single change
- Avoid vague or generic messages

#### How does a clear commit message help in team collaboration?
- Quickly understand the project history
- Review pull requests more easily

In large teams, a good message saves time and reduces misunderstandings.

#### How can poor commit messages cause issues later?
Vague messages like "fixed stuff" don't explain what was changed,
making code maintenance difficult.

Messages that are too long or disorganized also complicate reading the history
and make it harder to find relevant information
when a bug arises or a change needs to be rolled back.
