# CI/CD Reflection

## What is the purpose of CI/CD?
The purpose of CI/CD is to automate the process of integrating, testing, and delivering code changes. It helps detect errors early, ensures consistent quality, and allows teams to ship software faster and more reliably.

## How does automating style checks improve project quality?
Automating verifications ensures that code and documentation follow consistent standards.

## What are some challenges with enforcing checks in CI/CD?
* False positives
* Long feedback times depending on strict rules
* Maintenance as the project changes

## How do CI/CD pipelines differ between small projects and large teams?
Small projects are usually simple and have basic testing. But large projects have many more testing stages, security measures, and more quality controls before they can be approved.
