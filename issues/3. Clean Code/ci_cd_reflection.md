# CI/CD Reflection

## What is the purpose of CI/CD?
The purpose of CI/CD is to automate the process of integrating, testing, and delivering code changes. It helps detect errors early, ensures consistent quality, and allows teams to ship software faster and more reliably.

## How does automating style checks improve project quality?
Automated style checks ensure that code and documentation follow consistent standards. This reduces human errors, improves readability, and makes collaboration easier, especially in teams.

## What are some challenges with enforcing checks in CI/CD?
Some challenges include false positives, longer feedback times, and developer frustration when rules are too strict. It also requires maintenance as the project grows.

## How do CI/CD pipelines differ between small projects and large teams?
Small projects usually have simple pipelines focused on basic linting and tests. Large teams require more complex pipelines with multiple stages, parallel jobs, security scans, and approval gates.
