#### What was the issue with the original code?
The first functions lack type confirmation and nest more than one if statement, in addition to not displaying error messages, which can cause crashes.

#### How does handling errors improve reliability?
Informative error messages can indicate where the error originates and what is causing it, making it predictable and safer for the user.
