#### What code smells did you find in your code?
The code has all documented errors. Each example shows how these problems can make the code difficult to read as well as inefficient.

#### How did refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of the code?
By breaking down large functions into smaller, reusable methods, these changes make the code easier to understand and reduce the number of errors that can arise.

#### How can avoiding code smells make future debugging easier?
By writing functions better and naming variables logically, as well as documenting what each part of the code does, it's also good to follow reuse practices and name important files in an organized way.
