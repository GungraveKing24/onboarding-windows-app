* **Developers**: Design and build features. They write code, fix bugs, and ensure the application works efficiently and reliably.
* **QA (Quality Assurance)**: Test the product to identify bugs and verify that features meet quality standards before release.
* **Product Manager (PM)**: Defines the product vision, prioritizes features, and ensures the work aligns with business and user needs.

## 📝 Reflection

#### What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?
My role is **Developer**. I contribute to the Agile process by implementing assigned features, fixing reported issues, and continuously improving the codebase. By delivering small, incremental changes and responding to feedback, I help ensure steady progress and adaptability.

#### How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?
My responsibilities overlap most with **QA** and other developers. For example, when QA reports a bug, I review the issue, reproduce it locally, fix the problem, and notify QA so they can verify the solution. I also collaborate with other developers to review changes and avoid conflicts.

## 🛠️ Task

#### Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.
As a Developer, I am responsible for turning requirements and feedback into working code. I focus on delivering functional improvements, resolving issues, and keeping changes small and reviewable so they can move smoothly through the Kanban board.

#### Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.
I frequently collaborate with the **QA team**. For example, when a QA tester reports an issue through a GitHub issue or message, I review the reproduction steps, ask clarifying questions if needed, and provide updates once the fix is ready for re-testing.

#### To improve teamwork, I can:
- Ask for clear reproduction steps early
- Share short status updates after fixing an issue
- Notify QA immediately when a fix is ready so testing is not delayed
