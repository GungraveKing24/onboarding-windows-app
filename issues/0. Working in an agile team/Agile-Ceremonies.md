#### What are the main Agile ceremonies, and what is their purpose?
* **Daily Stand-ups**: Short meetings where team members share what they worked on, what they plan to do next, and any blockers.
* **Sprint Planning (Scrum) vs. Continuous Prioritization (Kanban)**:
  * *(Scrum)* The team plans a fixed set of work for a sprint with defined goals.
  * *(Kanban)* Work is continuously prioritized without fixed sprints, allowing more flexibility.
* **Retrospectives**: Meetings to reflect on what went well, what didn’t, and how to improve.
* **Backlog Refinement**: Sessions to clarify, estimate, and prioritize upcoming work.

#### How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?
Agile teams collaborate using written updates, shared task boards, documentation, and recorded meetings. These tools allow everyone to stay aligned without needing to be online at the same time.

#### How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?
Agile ceremonies provide structured and recurring opportunities to share progress, surface issues early, and align on priorities. This helps reduce misunderstandings and keeps the team focused on common goals.

#### Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?
Daily stand-ups are the most important because they help identify blockers early and give visibility into what the rest of the team is working on.

## 🛠️ Task

#### Attend a stand-up meeting and observe how updates are shared.

I attend a weekly stand-up meeting every Wednesday where the team shares progress from the past week.  
During the meeting, each team member takes turns explaining what they have been working on. Updates are usually shared by presenting the screen to visually show progress, combined with a brief verbal summary. Some team members also mention what they plan to work on next.

On **Wednesday, 28/01/26**, I shared my own update. I explained that I was working on the company onboarding process, specifically resolving assigned issues, and that I was close to finishing that work. I also mentioned that my next focus would be reviewing issues again in case the bot rejected them.

#### Participate in a retrospective or review past notes from one.

After the stand-up, notes from the meeting are automatically generated using an AI tool and sent to the team by email. These notes summarize what each team member shared and help keep track of progress asynchronously.

In addition to the AI-generated notes, I sometimes take my own notes using Notepad or Notion to keep a personal record of tasks completed and next steps. Reviewing these notes helps me stay aligned with team goals and remember feedback or follow-up actions discussed during the meeting.

#### Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration.

One improvement I can make is to consistently share clearer written summaries of my progress and blockers after meetings. This would help ensure that updates are easy to review later, especially for team members who rely on asynchronous communication or were unable to attend the meeting live.
