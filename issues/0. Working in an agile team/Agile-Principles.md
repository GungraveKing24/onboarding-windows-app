### What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?
Agile is an iterative and flexible approach to software development that focuses on delivering small, continuous improvements instead of large releases at the end of a project. Agile adapts to change and encourages frequent feedback from stakeholders.

Traditional project management (such as Waterfall) relies on detailed upfront planning, fixed requirements, and linear phases. Agile differs by allowing requirements to evolve over time, enabling teams to respond quickly to feedback and changing priorities.

### What are the core values and principles of Agile?
The four core Agile values are:
- **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**
- **Working software over comprehensive documentation**
- **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**
- **Responding to change over following a plan**

Some important Agile principles include:
- Deliver working software frequently
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
- Continuous attention to technical excellence
- Regular reflection on how to become more effective

These values and principles help teams stay focused on delivering real value while remaining flexible and collaborative.

### What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?
Scrum is a structured Agile framework with fixed sprint durations, defined roles, and regular ceremonies such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, reviews, and retrospectives. Scrum is useful when work can be planned in advance and delivered in predictable iterations.

Kanban is a continuous flow system without fixed sprints or strict roles. It focuses on visualizing work, limiting work in progress (WIP), and improving workflow efficiency. Kanban is best suited for teams that handle ongoing tasks or changing priorities.

### Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?
Focus Bear leans towards Kanban because it allows more flexibility and continuous delivery. Work can be prioritized and adjusted at any time without waiting for a sprint to end, which fits well with ongoing improvements, issue resolution, and asynchronous collaboration.

### What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?
The biggest benefits of Agile include flexibility, faster feedback, better collaboration, and the ability to adapt to constant change. These benefits help teams deliver value more frequently and improve based on real feedback.

One challenge of Agile is managing frequent changes without losing focus or clarity. Another challenge is maintaining alignment across the team, especially when priorities shift often or when working asynchronously.

### How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?
Agile principles help me focus on delivering value incrementally rather than trying to complete everything at once. Responding to feedback quickly allows me to improve my work when issues are flagged or changes are requested.

In my role, this is especially useful when working on tasks like onboarding or resolving issues, where reviews or automated checks may require multiple iterations and quick adjustments.
